# Humane Disease Network for Gene-linked Disease-Disease Associations on Comparative Toxicogenomic Dataset

## Dataset Preparation
A database of gene-disease association was downloaded from DisGenet. Top 300 diseases with the most number of gene influences from CTD (Comparative Toxicogenomics)
subset were chosen. CSV files for edges and nodes were prepared using SQL queries for subsequent downstream processing. 

## Tool and Algorithm 
Gephi with Force Atlas 2 as the layout algorithm, LinLog Mode for adjustment of scaling and gravity parameters and Dissuade Mode to push hubs to the periphery while keeping authorities in the centre.
